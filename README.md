# CAN2
## What is CAN2
CAN2 is neural network learning nonlinear functions and approximate them as piecewise linear function , using  Competitive net and associative net. 

You can apply CAN2 to "Nonlinear function learning problem " ,  " voice recognition problem" , "presuming amount of rainfall"  and so on.

CAN2py is a  program whose processing speed is superior to deep learning for artificial neural network developed by our laboratory ,Kurogi Lab.

You can use C or Python for CAN2.
